# Queer Calendar Sheffield

This is a project to pull information from various calendars in Sheffield to create a centralised list of Queer events.

Currently the whole thing is set up to run from a static site with no server side code, instead outsourcing the work of hosting the events to calendar providers like google calendar.

You can see the current site hosted here: https://canopusfalling.github.io/Queer-Calendar-Sheffield/
