# Accessibility Statement

---

## Introduction

Queer Calendar Sheffield is a website created entirely by volenteers to help promote LGBTQ+ events in Sheffield and make information about them more accessible. As such we have an incredibly strong committment to making sure that the information we colate is accessible to everyone and go to great lengths to ensure accessibility is a key consideration througout the development process.

## Compliance with Standards

We are attempting to stay compliant with [W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3 standard](https://w3.org/WAI/wcag3) this is still a working draft set of guidelines and may change over time so we won't always be perfectly up to date and compliant though we aim to be.

## Contact Information

Please reach out to us at [accessibility@queercalendarsheffield.co.uk](mailto:accessibility@queercalendarsheffield.co.uk) to report any accessibility issues, ask for assistence accessing the site or request an alternative format if needed. We aim to respond to inquiries within a week.

## Accessibility Features

- Where possible we make sure to ask event organisers about the accessibility of venues and list the information we are able to obtain. We also check the venue does have these features ourselves where possible.
- The website is designed to be easily navigable using only a keyboard for those who may need alternative input devices.
- All text has sufficient contrast to the background to improve readablility for those who have a visual imparement.
- The site is compatible with most screen readers. (Unfortunately due to the small nature of our development team we are not able to test this comprehensively. Please report any issues you may encounter.)

We encourage users to provide feedback on the accessibility of our website. Your insights are valuable in helping us enhance our features and address any potential barriers. Please report any issues or share your experiences with accessibility by contacting us at [accessibility@queercalendarsheffield.co.uk](mailto:accessibility@queercalendarsheffield.co.uk).

## Known issues

You can find a list of all the known accessibility issues [here](https://github.com/CanopusFalling/Queer-Calendar-Sheffield/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AAccessibility). Feel free to open a new issue if you encounter any accessibility-related problems. If you're unfamiliar with the process, please refer to [GitHub's guide on creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).

## Third-Party Content

This website may contain content from 3rd parties, some of this may be beyond our control and it may not be possible to ensure it is always accessible. We hope to be able to provide guidance and support for event organisers who wish to list their events here eventually, but this is not currently something we are capable of.

## Testing and Evaluation

Currently the testing is entirely manual and all done by one individual, we are working on putting in place more rigorous accessibility testing and review procedures and automating the process to help us catch issues before they go live.

## Updates to the Accessibility Statement

We aim to update this accessibility statement with every major update to the website, though we can't garentee any specific frequency due to the nature of being a volenteer run project.

## Legal Compliance

We are required by the UK Equality Act 2010 to make reasonable ajustments to ensure our service is accessible to all. We aim to exceed this requirement wherever possible.
